notes: 
Aubergine and mushroom tartar is inspired: 
Adds a great savoury flavour to the umami qualities of mushroom.
5mm dice, mushroom, aubergine & SO
Semi cook them in a dry non stick frying pan (hot enough to brown one side)
Cook the steaks in the same pan.
After each steak is cooked return the tartar mix to the pan and 
deglaze w/ 100ml of water, 
toss until all the is almost gone and the veg is nicely coated.
The result is a really steaky tasting mix - adds real flavour to a fatless dish!
